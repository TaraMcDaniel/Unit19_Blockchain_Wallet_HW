# Fintech Finder

## Instructions

I was asked to build an application that will enable users to find Fintech candidates.  This application has 4 candidates to chose from and provides their hourly wage in ETH.  Within Streamlit, you will decide which candidate you would like to hire as well as the number of hours.  Once you are satisfied with the amount of ETH, you will click the 'Send Transaction' button.  Once you click the 'Send Transaction' button, you will go to the Ganache application to verify the transaction is successful.  

## Results

Below are screenshots of me tesing the Fintech Finder application by hiring Lane for 2 hours.
